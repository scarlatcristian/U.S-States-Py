# U.S-States-Py

This Python script utilizes the `turtle` module to create an interactive game that quizzes users on U.S. states. Users are prompted to guess the names of U.S. states, and the program provides feedback on the correctness of the guesses.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This script requires the `turtle` and `pandas` modules, which can be installed using pip:

pip install pandas


## Usage

1. Download the script (`us_state_game.py`).
2. Download the U.S. states map image (`usa_states_map.gif`) and the CSV file containing state data (`usa_50_states.csv`).
3. Place the script and the required files in the same directory.
4. Run the script using Python:

python us_state_game.py


5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
6. Enter the name of a U.S. state when prompted.
7. Continue guessing until you've correctly identified all 50 states, or enter 'exit' to end the game.
